### To use cmake first you need to include CMakeLists.txt file (an example is in ~/Programming/) in the source folder (folder with the code).

### Then the next step is to make a build folder, cd into it and write this in terminal:

```
cmake path_to_source_folder
```

### Then once it's finished write the following:

```
cmake --build .
```

### And then you can run the project either by double clicking it or by typing:

```
./project_name
```
