Since vim doesnt support many options like Wayland clipboard and doesn't work properly with CoC, I decided to install neovim to use it for programming.

Neovim configuration file is located in:

```
~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

To run neovim, type:

```
nvim
```

I decided to keep vim to use it purely as a text editor in case I don't need all the extra stuff that neovim comes with.
